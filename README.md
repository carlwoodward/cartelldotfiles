# Kinesis Dotfiles

The included dotfiles provide a consistent development environment for Kinesis'
developers. The motivation behind a common configuration is to facilitate common practices
and easier pairing via tmux.

## Prerequisites

The following assumptions are made:

- [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) is used instead of Terminal.app
- [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) is used
- Latest version of tmux is installed from homebrew
- Latest version of zsh is installed from homebrew
- Latest version of vim is installed from homebrew
- User shell is changed to the homebrew version `/usr/local/bin/zsh`

## Installation

**Backup your existing dotfiles first.**

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/kinesisptyltd/dotfiles.git`
2. Clone vundle `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle`
3. Run `ruby go.rb`
